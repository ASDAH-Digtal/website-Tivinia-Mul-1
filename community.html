            <h1>What the netball community does here at asdah.</h1>
            <p>The purpose of the Netball Community is for the coaches inspire and connect Netball to over 140,000 Netball participants around the country each year. They 
            are the backbone of the Netball experience, dedicating time and energy to players and umpires to develop and grow.Netball and other team sports are associated with better health outcomes compared to individual exercise, due to the social nature of the activity. Team sports provide social connection, friendships outside of your usual tribe, and a sense of community. A team can be part of an increased support network, and you celebrate together, cry together you become soul sisters and soul mates. Sport and netball programmes can play a role in improving society and building better communities in rural and urban areas3.
            What the netball community does is that it influences those who do not know how to play and those who do know how to play to join out netball community teaching more kids and teenagers about the game of netball. Not only does this help kids and teenagers but it also helps bring our community together as one. Coming together for the support of there kids watching them grow up not only in a netball community but as a family community.</p>
